# Introduction to Simple Body Validator

Simple Body Validator is an open source validation library inspired by the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/validation) validation mechanism. The library's goal is to make data validation as easy as possible for Javascript developers on both client and server side.

The validation mechanism can be used with any popular framework like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

Simple Body Validator comes with a built-in translation mechanism that makes it convenient to retrieve error messages in multiple languages, thus allowing you to support multiple languages for your validation without the need of external libraries.

### No Dependencies 

The whole validation mechanism does not depend on any external package. There is no need to download several packages each time you want to use Simple Body Validator or to be linked to any third party library.
